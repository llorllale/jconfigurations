# jconfigurations

Inspired by [jcommander](https://github.com/cbeust/jcommander), this library provides simple and intuitive *injection* of configurations into object attributes of your choosing. It is intended for use in non-managed environments or projects where [JSR 299: Contexts and Dependency Injection for the JavaTM EE platform](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=299) would be overkill.
